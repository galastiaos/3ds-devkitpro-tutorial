# 3ds-devkitpro-tutorial
A tutorial on how to develop (very basic) 3ds homebrew apps with devkitPro on Windows, macOS, and Linux.

# What classifies as "Linux":
When i say Linux, I do not (nescesarily) mean full blown KDE or Ubuntu through a GUI(though they can be used), rather stuff with any sort of Linux kernel. This could get technical, but my list is this:
- ChromeOS Linux
- MinGW on Windows/WSL(Pain in the butt, but you can ifi you want)
- macOS(yes, it actually is quite similair to Linux, it uses a Linux kernel*
- A Linux distribution like Debian, Ubuntu, Arch, Kali, etc.

*:Technically not Linux, rather FreeBSD, but that's basically just a linux kernel with extra steps. Also, it's not just a straight rip of FreeBSD, but it's based off of it. Look into the history of it if you want, I'm not getting into much detail.

# Why'd I mention Linux?

Because, devkitPro is a Linux thing. Considering Linux is a relatively unpopular operating system, macOS and Windows users(the vast majority of you reading this guide I assume), windows needs a little help, via minGW. Install that and come back here.(or enable WSL, as long as it works)

# Actually getting started
Ok, so, open up your terminal(or minGW if you're on windows)
