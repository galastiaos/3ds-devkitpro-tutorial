# 3ds-devkitpro-tutorial
A tutorial on how to develop (very basic) 3ds homebrew apps with devkitPro on Windows, macOS, and Linux.

# What classifies as "Linux":
When i say Linux, I do not (nescesarily) mean full blown KDE or Ubuntu(though they can be used), rather stuff with any sort of Linux kernel. This could get technical, but my list is this:
- ChromeOS Linux
- MinGW on Windows/WSL(Pain in the butt, but you can ifi you want)
- macOS(yes, it actually is quite similair to Linux, it uses a Linux kernel*
- A Linux distribution like Debian, Ubuntu, Arch, Kali, etc.

*:Technically not Linux, rather FreeBSD, but that's basically just a linux kernel with extra rwpa
